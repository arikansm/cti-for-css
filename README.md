`cti-for-css` is a cutting-edge system designed to automate the production of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) for closed-source software vulnerabilities. Utilizing deep learning algorithms and an innovative function-as-sentence approach, this tool simplifies the detection and classification of software vulnerabilities.

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Supports MLP, OneDNN (One-Dimensional CNN), LSTM, and Bi-LSTM for vulnerability detection.
- **High Performance**: Achieved an F1 score of 82.4% and AUC score of 93.0%.
- **Fast Processing**: Classifies each vulnerability in under 0.32 seconds on average.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Can be trained using the SOSP and NDSS18 datasets, covering CWE-119 (buffer errors) and CWE-399 (resource management errors), or with other datasets formatted similarly to these.

## Function-as-Sentence Approach
The system introduces a novel method to represent binary data, reducing pre-processing workload and enhancing detection accuracy.

## Complementary Tools

We have made available the source code of `cti-for-css` along with three complementary tools:

1. **`cti-for-css-library-usage`**  
   Demonstrates how to integrate and use the `cti-for-css` system as a library within your projects.
