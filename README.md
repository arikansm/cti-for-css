# Automating shareable cyber threat intelligence production for closed source software vulnerabilities: a deep learning based detection system

The paper is available at https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-024-00882-4.

We have made available the source code of cti-for-css. We have also shared three different tools: cti-for-css-library-usage, which shows how to use the system; cti-for-css-gui, which provides a graphical interface; and cti-for-css-stix-viewer, which visualises the produced cyber threat intelligence.
